# Inferring-Relation-Among-Very-Large-Numbers-by-Using-RNNs
You are given three very large numbers  A,  B, and  C. It is believed that there are some relation among the three numbers, i.e.,  C=f ( A,B )  for some  f ( ) . Since the given numbers are very large, which may exceed the length of the integer representation of your computers. Therefore, one way to address the problem is to use a RNN to infer the unknown relation through digit-wise operations on  A  and  B . You can build your own RNNs, including the vanilla RNNs, multilayer RNNs, or bidirectional RNNs, using the layers of SimpleRNN, LSTM, and GRU. The more in-depth studies you do on using different RNNs, the higher score you may get from this assignment.
